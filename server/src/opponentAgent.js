/**
 * Courtroom Opponent Simulation Agent (Adversarial Legal Preparation)
 *
 * Simulates opposing counsel to rigorously pressure-test the user's case dossier.
 * Generates:
 *  1. Opposing Theory of the Case (alternative narratives, statutory exceptions, procedural objections)
 *  2. Evidence Attack (vulnerabilities, admissibility under BSA 2023, missing corroboration)
 *  3. Cross-Examination Simulator (grounded questions, targets, preparation advice)
 *  4. Adverse Authorities & Distinguishing Precedents
 *  5. Ranked Opponent Move Prediction (with plausibility & impact)
 *  6. Rebuttal & Counter-Strategy Blueprint
 *  7. Scenario Sensitivity Testing ("What If" contingencies)
 *
 * Strict Rule: Grounded purely in case dossier facts and verified law; no hallucinations.
